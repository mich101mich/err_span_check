//! #### &emsp;A compiler diagnostics testing library in just 2 functions.
//!
//! Trybuild is a test harness for invoking rustc on a set of test cases and
//! asserting that any resulting error messages are the ones intended.
//!
//! Such tests are commonly useful for testing error reporting involving
//! procedural macros. We would write test cases triggering either errors
//! detected by the macro or errors detected by the Rust compiler in the
//! resulting expanded code, and compare against the expected errors to ensure
//! that they remain user-friendly.
//!
//! This style of testing is sometimes called *ui tests* because they test
//! aspects of the user's interaction with a library outside of what would be
//! covered by ordinary API tests.
//!
//! Nothing here is specific to macros; err_span_check would work equally well for
//! testing misuse of non-macro APIs.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Compile-fail tests
//!
//! A minimal err_span_check setup looks like this:
//!
//! ```
//! # #[allow(clippy::test_attr_in_doctest)]
//! #[test]
//! fn ui() {
//!     let t = err_span_check::TestCases::new();
//!     t.test("tests/ui/*.rs");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The test can be run with `cargo test`. It will individually compile each of
//! the source files matching the glob pattern, expect them to fail to compile,
//! and assert that the compiler's error message matches an adjacently named
//! _*.stderr_ file containing the expected output (same file name as the test
//! except with a different extension). If it matches, the test case is
//! considered to succeed.
//!
//! Dependencies listed under `[dev-dependencies]` in the project's Cargo.toml
//! are accessible from within the test cases.
//!

//!
//! Failing tests display the expected vs actual compiler output inline.

//! A compile_fail test that fails to fail to compile is also a failure.

//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! That's the entire API.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Workflow
//!
//! There are two ways to update the _*.stderr_ files as you iterate on your
//! test cases or your library; handwriting them is not recommended.
//!
//! First, if a test case is being run as compile_fail but a corresponding
//! _*.stderr_ file does not exist, the test runner will save the actual
//! compiler output with the right filename into a directory called *wip* within
//! the directory containing Cargo.toml. So you can update these files by
//! deleting them, running `cargo test`, and moving all the files from *wip*
//! into your testcase directory.
//!
//! <p align="center">
//! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1940490/57186579-7cd51580-6e96-11e9-9f19-54dcecc9fbba.png" width="700">
//! </p>
//!
//! Alternatively, run `cargo test` with the environment variable
//! `ERR_SPAN_CHECK=overwrite` to skip the *wip* directory and write all compiler
//! output directly in place. You'll want to check `git diff` afterward to be
//! sure the compiler's output is what you had in mind.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # What to test
//!
//! When it comes to compile-fail tests, write tests for anything for which you
//! care to find out when there are changes in the user-facing compiler output.
//! As a negative example, please don't write compile-fail tests simply calling
//! all of your public APIs with arguments of the wrong type; there would be no
//! benefit.
//!
//! A common use would be for testing specific targeted error messages emitted
//! by a procedural macro. For example the derive macro from the [`ref-cast`]
//! crate is required to be placed on a type that has either `#[repr(C)]` or
//! `#[repr(transparent)]` in order for the expansion to be free of undefined
//! behavior, which it enforces at compile time:
//!
//! [`ref-cast`]: https://github.com/dtolnay/ref-cast
//!
//! ```console
//! error: RefCast trait requires #[repr(C)] or #[repr(transparent)]
//!  --> $DIR/missing-repr.rs:3:10
//!   |
//! 3 | #[derive(RefCast)]
//!   |          ^^^^^^^
//! ```
//!
//! Macros that consume helper attributes will want to check that unrecognized
//! content within those attributes is properly indicated to the caller. Is the
//! error message correctly placed under the erroneous tokens, not on a useless
//! call\_site span?
//!
//! ```console
//! error: unknown serde field attribute `qqq`
//!  --> $DIR/unknown-attribute.rs:5:13
//!   |
//! 5 |     #[serde(qqq = "...")]
//!   |             ^^^
//! ```
//!
//! Declarative macros can benefit from compile-fail tests too. The [`json!`]
//! macro from serde\_json is just a great big macro\_rules macro but makes an
//! effort to have error messages from broken JSON in the input always appear on
//! the most appropriate token:
//!
//! [`json!`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/1.0/serde_json/macro.json.html
//!
//! ```console
//! error: no rules expected the token `,`
//!  --> $DIR/double-comma.rs:4:38
//!   |
//! 4 |     println!("{}", json!({ "k": null,, }));
//!   |                                      ^ no rules expected this token in macro call
//! ```
//!
//! Sometimes we may have a macro that expands successfully but we count on it
//! to trigger particular compiler errors at some point beyond macro expansion.
//! For example the [`readonly`] crate introduces struct fields that are public
//! but readable only, even if the caller has a &mut reference to the
//! surrounding struct. If someone writes to a readonly field, we need to be
//! sure that it wouldn't compile:
//!
//! [`readonly`]: https://github.com/dtolnay/readonly
//!
//! ```console
//! error[E0594]: cannot assign to data in a `&` reference
//!   --> $DIR/write-a-readonly.rs:17:26
//!    |
//! 17 |     println!("{}", s.n); s.n += 1;
//!    |                          ^^^^^^^^ cannot assign
//! ```
//!
//! In all of these cases, the compiler's output can change because our crate or
//! one of our dependencies broke something, or as a consequence of changes in
//! the Rust compiler. Both are good reasons to have well conceived compile-fail
//! tests. If we refactor and mistakenly cause an error that used to be correct
//! to now no longer be emitted or be emitted in the wrong place, that is
//! important for a test suite to catch. If the compiler changes something that
//! makes error messages that we care about substantially worse, it is also
//! important to catch and report as a compiler issue.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Troubleshooting
//!
//! The Rust compiler's diagnostic output can vary as a function of whether the
//! `rust-src` Rustup component is installed. The compiler will render source
//! snippets from the standard library if the standard library source is
//! available locally, and will simply omit snippets if not. This can account
//! for differences between CI and local development.
//!
//! If you have compile_fail tests pertaining to standard library traits or
//! types, you can ensure a consistent environment by adding a
//! rust-toolchain.toml file with the following content.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [toolchain]
//! components = ["rust-src"]
//! ```
